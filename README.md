# Computational and Deep Learning projects
This repository contains scripts for two projects related to predicting patient outcome data using real hospital data.

- Project 1 focuses on predicting whether a patient will die based on their demographics and vitals
- Project 2 focuses on predicting the length of stay in the hospital, also based on their demographics and vitals
